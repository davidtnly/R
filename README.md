## Lending Club Data in R

## Overview

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company and the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform. In this project, I will be working on exploratory data analysis to building a predictive model that will determine if a loan on LendingClub will default. You can find the data using LC's website or on Kaggle.
